text:

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure, done under general anesthesia, in which electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally causing a brief seizure. Although ECT has remained the most effective acute treatment for major depressive episodes for nearly 80 years, how it works and why it is effective is not well known. Only a small proportion of patients with treatment resistant depression are offered ECT, and typically 60-80\% experience a good response (> 50\% symptom reduction).

Several neuroimaging studies of ECT have demonstrated volume increases of brain areas after treatment. The most consistent finding has been volume increase of the hippocampus. However, a link between the treatment induced brain changes and clinical improvement has not been established.

This project explores how ECT changes the brain, and if the structural (or functional) changes that are seen can explain the effect (or side-effects) of the treatment.

An important reason for our knowledge gap is that single studies have limited samples and lack statistical power to reach firm conclusions. The Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration was founded with a belief that collaboration and mega-analysis of combined data will lead to new knowledge that can be generalized across individual research sites.

In May 2019 the group arranged a gathering to discuss how to combine the neuropsychological analyses with data in the study. At the seminar, Åsa Hammar (neuropsychologist and professor), Maria Semkovska (neuropsychologist and experienced researcher in the ECT field), Olga Therese Ousdal (PhD), Hauke Bartsch (director of informatics, image analyst IV), Ole Johan Evjenth Sørhaug (medical student), and Shawn McClintoch (neuropsychologist (via Skype)) presented ongoing projects, preliminary analyses, earlier research, and future recommendations. The gathering was a good day for discussions and new ideas.
