\textbf{Research focus:} 
Technology is revolutionizing medicine.  New scanners enable doctors to "look into the patientâ€™s body" and study their anatomy and physiology without the need of a scalpel.  At an amazing speed new scanning technologies emerge, providing an ever growing and increasingly varied look into medical conditions.  Today, we cannot "only" look at the bones within a body, but we can also examine soft tissue, blood flow, activation networks in the brain, and many more aspects of anatomy and physiology.  The increased amount and complexity of the acquired medical imaging data leads to new challenges in knowledge extraction and decision making.

In order to optimally exploit this new wealth of information, it is crucial that all this imaging data is successfully linked to the medical condition of the patient.  In many cases, this is challenging, for example, when diagnosing early-stage cancer or mental disorders.  Analogous to biomarkers, which are molecular structures that are used to identify medical conditions, imaging biomarkers are information structures in medical images that can help with diagnostics and treatment planning, formulated in terms of features that can be computed from the imaging data.  Imaging biomarker discovery is a highly challenging task and traditionally only a single hypothesis (for a new biomarker) is examined at a time.  This makes it impossible to explore a large number as well as more complex imaging biomarkers across multi-aspect data.  In the VIDI project, we propose to research and advance visual data science to improve imaging biomarker discovery through the visual integration of multi-aspect medical data with a new visualization-enabled hypothesis management framework.

\noindent
\textbf{Project:} 
We aim to reduce the time it takes to discover new imaging biomarkers by studying structured sets of hypotheses, to be examined at the same time, through the integration of computational approaches and interactive visual analysis techniques.  Another related goal is to enable the discovery of more complex imaging biomarkers, across multiple modalities, that potentially are able to more accurately characterize diseases.  This should lead to a new form of designing innovative and effective imaging protocols and to the discovery of new imaging biomarkers, improving suboptimal imaging protocols and thus also reducing scanning costs.  Our project is a truly interdisciplinary research effort, bringing visualization research and imaging research together in one project, and this is perfectly suited for the novel Centre for Medical Imaging and Visualization that has been established in Bergen, Norway
