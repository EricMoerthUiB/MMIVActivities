This talk was presented by Heidi Espedal of MMIV. It is titled "Imaging of preclinical gynecologic cancer models". She is a post-doctoral fellow working at the molecular imaging center (MIC) of Haukeland University Hospital.

She introduced her talk with: {\it 
Endometrial cancer is the most common type of cancer of the female reproductive
tract. Although prognosis is generally good for patients with low-grade and early-stage diseases, the outcomes for high-grade and metastatic/recurrent cases remain poor, since traditional therapy have limited effects. No targeted agents have been approved so far, although several new drugs have been tested without striking results in clinical trials. Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) mouse models represent useful tools for preclinical evaluation of new therapies and biomarker identification. Preclinical imaging by PET-CT and MRI during disease progression enables visualization and quantification of functional tumor characteristics, which may serve as imaging biomarkers guiding targeted therapies. The primary objective for this presentation is to give an introduction of current and novel preclinical imaging methods relevant for endometrial cancer mouse models.
