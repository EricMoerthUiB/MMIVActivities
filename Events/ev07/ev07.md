This talk was presented by Rune Eikeland of MMIV. It is titled "The Human Connectome Project data processing pipeline and data visualization toolbox".

He introduced his talk with: {\it 
The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a five-year project sponsored by sixteen components of the National Institutes of Health, split between two consortia of research institutions. The project was launched in July 2009 as the first of three Grand Challenges of the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience Research.

The goal of the Human Connectome Project is to build a "network map" (connectome) that will shed light on the anatomical and functional connectivity within the healthy human brain, as well as to produce a body of data that will facilitate research into brain disorders such as dyslexia, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia.

The data, processing and visualization tools are freely available for the HCP and Rune will present them in this talk with an in-depth focus on EPI data pre-processing to reduce susceptibility and motion artefacts with FSL’s eddy tool (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/eddy).
