This talk was presented by Noeska Smit of the MMIV. It is titled "Memento: Localized Time-Warping for Spatio-Temporal Selection in fMRI data".

She introduced her talk with: {\it 
Interaction techniques for temporal data are often focused on affecting the spatial aspects of the data, for instance through the use of transfer functions, camera navigation, or clipping planes. However, the temporal aspect of the data interaction is often neglected. The temporal component is either visualized as individual time steps, an animation, or a static summary over the temporal domain. We propose a novel technique that allows users to interactively specify areas of interest in the spatio-temporal domain. By employing a time-warp function, we are able to slow down time, freeze time, or even travel back in time, around spatio-temporal events of interest. The combination of such a (pre-defined) time-warp function and brushing directly in the data to select regions of interest allows for a detailed review of temporally and spatially localized events, while maintaining an overview of the global spatio-temporal data. In this talk, I will demonstrate an application of this technique to functional MRI (fMRI) data in particular.}
