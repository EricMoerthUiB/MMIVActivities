No prior programming experience is required and everyone is welcome to our class, but bring a laptop.
We start with an overview of tasks related to data imports and quality checks, cover basic visualization 
using ggplot2 and the simplest of regression models suitable as a baseline classification
for your machine learning projects. Due to the complexity of the statistical models we will focus in this
class on the data management part which starts any analysis task in the R-programming language.

R is especially suited as a programming language supporting data management tasks as
well as basic and advanced statistical analysis tasks. With high-quality
graphic generating packages all components of a scientific paper for bio-science can be created
using R. In class we will use RStudio an integrated development environment that provides a convenient
MATLAB-like interface for our class. The notebook feature is similar to python-notebooks and combines
explanatory text, programming code and output generated by R.

Together with the RStudio environment the CRAN package store is a useful repository of many advanced
packages that integrate with R. We will use the TableOne package to explain how R can be extended with
CRAN software. In the last part of the workshop we will look at ggplot as a language for specifying 
graphics in R.

In a future workshop we will focus on the basic statistical packages for linear models up to the use of
generalized additive mixed models (gamm4, mgcv). Such packages provide the tools for many life-science
analysis tasks.
