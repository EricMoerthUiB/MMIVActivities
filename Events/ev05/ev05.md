This talk was presented by Njål Lura of MMIV. It is titled "MRI-assessed tumor size parameters predict mortality in uterine cervical cancer".

He introduced his talk with: {\it 
Uterine cervical cancer represents a major threat to female health worldwide; it is the fourth most common female cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in low-income countries. Important limitations in cervical cancer treatment are due to: 1) insufficient diagnostic tools with which to identify high-risk disease and 2) insufficient diagnostic tools with which to guide more individualized treatment. This project aims to address these limitations by focusing on the value of preoperative advanced imaging to provide functional and morphological tumor characteristics relevant for treatment and prognosis in uterine cervical cancer.
