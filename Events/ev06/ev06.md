This talk was presented by Saruar Alam of MMIV. It is titled "MRI-assessed tumor size parameters predict mortality in uterine cervical cancer".

He introduced his talk with: {\it 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be distinguished using the features obtained from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a supervised classifier. Multi-atlas-based-likelihood fusion (MALF) algorithms extract the volumes features of subcortical regions of interest (ROI). The correlation among these ROI features from different brain regions may provide additional valuable information. Subsequently, these ROI-correlative features may affect the classification performance of a supervised classifier. We have classified AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment from cognitively normal subjects using these features and a Support Vector Machine classifier. This article investigates the difference in classification performance between the ROI and ROI-correlative features. Our work also reports the ranks of ROI and ROI-correlative regions. We have observed marginal differences in classification performance and ranking of the most effective regions.
