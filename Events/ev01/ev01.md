No prior programing skills are required to participate in this class but, bring a laptop and
actively participate. After this class you can create a single page web applications for 
your machine learning and visualization projects that run on all major web-browsers and have
an interface that people are familiar with. Programming concepts are explained in
class and step by step we will enhance our example application with interactive components.

\noindent
Any web-application consists of two components, the web-server that provides the database and 
the client application component that is executed in the users browser. All programming logic is
executed on the client application programmed in JavaScript - a programming language designed
for the web. The minimal server component is programmed in our class in PHP, a simple programming 
language for the server that implements for example authentication (not covered in this class).

\noindent
We will focus our efforts on the client side programming and explain how events trigger actions
that result in an update of the interface which creates reactive web experience for the user. 
The capabilities of styling the website using cascading style sheets (CSS) will allow us to
generate custom interface components for special needs. For a basic styling framework we will 
use Bootstrap (v4). This library extends the HTML code describing the interface by an easy to
understand grid-based layout that adapts to the size of the screen. Our applications will therefore
adjust to large screens as well as cell-phones.
