This talk was presented by Sathiesh Kaliyugarasan of MMIV. It is titled "Artificial intelligence in image diagnostics – transfer learning and active learning for efficient use of data and radiologist’s expertise". Sathiesh is a PhD candidate at the MMIV.

He introduced his talk with: {\it 
A common stumbling block for supervised learning methods based on deep neural networks is the large number of labeled examples required for training. This is particularly troublesome when trying to use deep learning methods for segmentation in 3D medical image data.
As creating labeled data for medical images is often a time-consuming, difficult and unreliable process, the amount of training data available is in general very small. To mitigate this problem we are looking into using design methodologies such as transfer learning and active learning for efficient use of data and radiologist’s expertise.
