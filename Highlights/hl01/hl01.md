\subsection*{MMIV retreat at Solstrand Hotel}

To kick off the opening of the new location at Haraldsplass for the MMIV centre, we organized a retreat at the Solstrand hotel in order to get to know each other and further develop plans for the future of the centre. In the two-day meeting in March, every centre member gave a short presentation introducing themselves and their research activities. In addition to the scientific program, the social program enabled everyone to get to know their colleagues in the now co-located centre.

\subsection*{Helse Vest funding to MMIV initiatives}
Helse-Vest has allocated funds to 61 of the total 285 applications submitted by the deadline of September 15. Njål Lura, PhD candidate in the gynecological cancer imaging project, has received PhD funding from this competitive call. In addition, Satheshkumar (Sathiesh) Kaliyugarasan has received PhD funding for his project in machine learning.

Cecilie Brekke Rygh was awarded financial support for her project "Imaging biomarkers for precision medicine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)", in which Noeska Smit and Alexander Lundervold co-lead a workpackage on image data analyses and visualization. 

\subsection*{MMIV at Christiekonferansen}
In the "Forsking i front" session from 11:30-12:00, Kristine Eldevik Fasmer presented a talk entitled "Kan vi lære maskiner å finne kreft i MR-bilder?". Kristine, who is a PhD student in the cancer imaging project, talks about her work on machine learning for cancer detection in MRI images. The machine learning project had a stand in the exhibition area, also. Here, they showcased a live demo of human action recognition using deep learning, and displayed how deep neural networks can be used to process and produce useful predictions based on medical images.

\subsection*{MMIV and COVID-19}

The COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of 2020 allowed researchers of MMIV to focus on research efforts of disease prevention and characterization of patient data affected by the outbreak. The MMIV clinical response team created tools and procedures to manage the data capture of COVID-19 cases for image and assessment instruments. This included simple measures such as adjusting the radiology workflow at MMIV to allow all radiologists working at MMIV to occupy separate offices, limiting the potential effects of an outbreak. All MMIV seminars switched to a virtual solution.

\subsection*{MMIV researchers awarded NOK 7m from NRC}

In 2020 we received new funding for a project on workflow-related machine learning from the Norwegian Research Council. The project is headed by Hauke Bartsch, Alexander Lundervold, Ingfrid Haldorsen, Arvid Lundervold, Erlend Hodneland, and Erling Andersen. The primary objective of this project is to construct a robust, working prototype that receive a DICOM study pushed from the PACS system, setup and run it through deep learning-based image processing methods, and format and return the resulting information, segmentation mask, derived reports, and quantitative measures back into the PACS. The system will also facilitate the evaluation and further training of the deep learning model based on feedback from the user by storing such modifications as annotations in the PACS. The prototype workflow will be assessed by experienced radiologists from the relevant clinical domains. Secondary objective is to prove that our approach is generalizable. This objective is three-fold: the approach should generalize to other computational medical imaging methods, different medical applications, and provide a clear path to embed our product in production-level, widely used PACS and image reading systems.
