To kick off the opening of the new location at Haraldsplass for the MMIV centre, we organized a retreat at the Solstrand hotel in order to get to know each other and further develop plans for the future of the centre. In the two-day meeting, every centre member gave a short presentation introducing themselves and their research activities. In addition to the scientific program, the social program enabled everyone to get to know their colleagues in the now co-located centre.
