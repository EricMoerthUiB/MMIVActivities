Marek Kocinski has a master's degree in electronics and
telecommunication and a Ph.D. at Computer Science from the Lodz
University of Technology (TUL) in Poland. From 2009 he has been
working as an Assistant Professor at Institute of Electronics in TUL.
His scientific interests concentrate on 2D, 3D and 4D biomedical image
processing, 3D visualization, texture analysis and data mining. He has
been involved in projects related to quantitative analysis and
modelling of DCE MRI images for tissue characterization in kidney,
prostate, endometrial carcinoma, as well as computer algorithms of
vascular tree growth, blood flow computer simulation through vascular
tree and compartmental model of exchange between blood vessel and
surrounding tissue. He is currently working as a postdoctoral
researcher in the project "Computational medical imaging and machine
learning â€“ methods, infrastructure and applications" at Mohn Medical
Imaging and Visualization Centre (MMIV). His research activities are
related to design methodologies for 3D biomedical image analysis with
the use of deep learning.
