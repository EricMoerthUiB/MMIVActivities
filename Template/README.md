### Build system

In order to create the PDF document you can use the Makefile provided in this folder. The project depends on pdflatex and python3, so you need to have such software installed on your computer before you can generate a new version of the PDF.

Submit new text artifacts using the provided examples in the Events, Software, Dissertations, and Projects folders.

If all required software components are installed on your system you should be able to generate a new PDF document with
```
make
```

This has been tested on MacOS and Windows.
