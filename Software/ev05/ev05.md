\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{Black}T}{} his repository provides access to programs developed at MMIV for the removal of participant identifying information in meta-data tags of DICOM files.

This source code demonstrates how to anonymize DICOM files based on the DICOM PS 3.15 AnnexE. I provide a Dockerfile that can be used to build the executable and to run anonymizations. Entries such as uid entries are replaced with hash values. This ensures that partial runs of a studies DICOM files can be merged afterwards. This project is written in C++ using the gdcm library and multiple threads to accelerate processing.

{\bf Warning}: The operation performed by this tool is a 'soft' de-identification. Instead of a white list of allowed tags the tool keeps a list of tags known to frequently contain personal identifying information (PII) and replaces only those. On the command line you specify a patient identifier (PatientID/PatientName). Only if you do not keep a mapping of the new and the old identifier this is considered an anonymization. If such a list exists the operation performed is a de-identification (permits a later re-identification).

I suggest to review files generated by this tool for additional PII information that might be present in text fields.

For a more flexible anonymizer please see the CTP DICOM Anonymizer project.

\subsection*{Unique features}
\begin{itemize}
\item{fast de-identification (multi-threaded, C++)}
\item{de-identifies data inside sequences instead of deleting them so overlays survive the procedure}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Limitations}

This tool has been written to work as an importer for a (vendor neutral) PACS system. In such a setup data de-identified from the same participant is expected to align with previous data for the same participant and study if the same participant ID and name is used. This is achieved by using study instance uids that are hashed. Series that comes later should therefore match at the study level. It is not possible to recover the original patient ID, patient name and study/series/image instance UIDs from the de-identified fields as no tracking information is stored in the DICOM files. But, identical input data will result in the same hashes. This can be seen as an implicit coupling list - a price we have to pay to be able to use the tool in our research PACS during the data capture stage of a project.

The used SHA256 algorithm for hashing per project is very fast to compute. This will allow an attacker to create many random tries for a brute-force attack. At the worst case this would allow the attacker to recover the original study/series/image instance UIDs. PatientID and PatientName tags are set manually and are therefore not exposed to such an attack.

We share such source code to support similar research efforts internationally. The open-source nature of this research allows national and international researchers to test and verify our solutions, provide essential feedback and suggestions for improvement supporting advances in medical data handling.
