\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{Black}T}{} his repository provides access to programs developed at MMIV for the removal of burned in pixel information in secondary capture DICOM images.

Sharing medical images is most often straight forward as the DICOM format provides a globally agreed on file format for all reconstructed 2D, 3D, and 4D data generated by medical equipment. Special care has to be taken if DICOM data is generated as part of data analysis workflows. Such 'secondary-capture' DICOM images can contain burned in text information that might contain participant identifying information such as names. Before such data can be shared as part of research projects at Haukeland University Hospital the burned in image information needs to be removed. Previous approaches 

This project uses the tesseract optical character recognition machine learning engine to identify text that is burned into DICOM images. For each text fragment (usually a word) a square black frame is written into the DICOM pixel information. The resulting DICOM file should be inspected - hopefully it is free of participant identifying information.

Warning: This program does not try to anonymize DICOM tags. Please check out the https://github.com/mmiv-center/DICOMAnonymizer project for a fast tag anonymizer.

Warning: There is no information yet on false/positive detection rates, verify the output by hand!

We share such source code to support similar research efforts internationally. The open-source nature of this research allows national and international researchers to test and verify our solutions, provide essential feedback and suggestions for improvement supporting advances in medical data handling.
