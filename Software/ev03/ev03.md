\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{Black}T}{} his repository provides access to programs developed at MMIV for lung segmentation of spiral CT images. This program is using a series of labelling and morphological operations to extract the Lung volume intensity image from chest CT scans. It was tested with the data from the LIDC-IDRI (Lung Image Database Consortium) project and depends on ITK/cmake.

After the initial step of extracting the intensities of the lungs and airways the algorithm attempts to separate the two lungs and the airways.
