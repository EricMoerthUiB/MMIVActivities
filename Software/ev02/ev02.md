\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{Black}T}{} his repository contains a program that
can create random participant identifiers based on a regular expression pattern. This 
allows the project to use short participant identifiers that do not repeat and that
blind the study to the order of enrollment. The generated participant identifiers 
remain concise and recognizable as belonging to the study. The software is part
of the Research PACS at MMIV that provides a safe technical solution to perform
medical data collection and data analysis.
