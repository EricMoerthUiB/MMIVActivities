\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{Black}T}{} his repository provides access to program developed at MMIV that creates random participant identifiers based on a regular expression pattern. This 
feature allows research projects to use short participant identifiers that do not repeat and that blind the study to the order of enrollment. The generated participant identifiers 
remain concise and recognizable as belonging to the study. The software is part
of the Research PACS at MMIV that provides a safe technical solution to perform
medical data collection and data analysis.
